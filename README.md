DISCLAIMER: I am not the creator of the original flappy bird, and this custom copy game I’ve created is not for commercial use, simply a person project to work on my game development skills

## Game Overview

This is my first game made in unity compatible with both a computer and mobile! However, please note that Unity’s WebGL publishing format may not be very user-friendly or even working depending on what mobile phone you use. I do not provide the file for android phones to run this game because I am not uploading it for commercial use.
